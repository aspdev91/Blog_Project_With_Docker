# Blog_Project

Please create a NodeJS project for a Blog API.  It should support authenticated endpoints 
for authors to create posts, allow public commenting and public viewing of posts / comments.
No visual UI is required.  Choose whatever database / storage repository you prefer.
The project should include simple setup instructions and example curl requests or other form of 
API documentation so as to allow a developer to quickly start calling your APIs.  We are looking 
for a functioning API along with high quality code, basic docs, use of best practices, and tests. 
Please place it up on github once you've completed it. # Blog_Project_Final
